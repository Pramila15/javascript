//Just like map(), reduce() also iterates through the entire array and it accepts a callback function to perform some action on the array element.
//The difference here is that reduce() passes the result of the callback from one
//iterartion to the next one. This callback result is called accumulator. The accumulator can be anythin(integer , string) and must be instantiated and passed when calling reduce().

//syntax 
//arr.reduce((acc,item) => {
    //callback fun body
//},acc_default_value)
